# framer-syntax-twist
So basically, this is a port of [framer-new-syntax](https://github.com/lol-russo/framer-new-syntax) from Atom to VS Code, with a base config
from [framer-syntax](https://github.com/framer/syntax).

It should look nice for basically any language, there is generic support for js, css, markdown, and json. There are also some extra configuration settings for Dart in here too.
